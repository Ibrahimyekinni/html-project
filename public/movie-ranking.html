<h1>The Best Movies According to Ibrahim</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Baki hanma </h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime. Although it's a series, I love the actions and fightings in it. I also love how they
    explain the depth of martial arts and how some techniques came to be. This is one anime I'll never forget. </p>

<h3>Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw</h3>
<p>It's a really cool sci-fi movie.</p>

<h3>Drive</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film. Really artistic.</p>
